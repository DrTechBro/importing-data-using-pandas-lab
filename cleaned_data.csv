Manager doesn't take accountability for the lack of attention to detail of his staff or their errors.  Tried to blame me because they didnt believe I put anything on the envelope. Account numbers and account holder names sitting all over Christopher the teller's desk. People wonder why your accounts are compromised? Manager saw it and did nothing. ,,,,,,,no review,,

Ice cream ($6 I would say they should be priced more at $4) was good quality for a soft serve.... It was defiantly not the same quality as McDonald's or an ice cream truck WAY better.

744,07F9bkUm3cs83CzGvTi0TA,1,2015-03-15,0,wgr_hOfIWlXR-glOC-qKYQ,5,kudos to charlotte motor speedway!! they took a situation that was less than idea at the all star race and turned it into a customer service win. here is what happened. i used ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the all star race. i browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in chrysler section k. when we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. i didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way i searched i missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. i was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. the employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the ticketmaster system so i would have to go to gate 4. at this point i'm not pleased but i head to gate 4. i show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. after about 20 or 30 minutes i'm informed by someone who i assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. at this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. we head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. he said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. at this point i'm furious. so we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said i did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!! way to go cms even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life!,1,Cxv3SNudPrCavvHJfIbwhQ

I went to do the tests the same day. After waiting for about 2 weeks and I did not hear from Dr. Steven Folkerth about the result of my tests. I called his office and the receptionist said she has the result in. I went in to pick up a copy of the tests and the receptionist was still unfriendly. I saw that my triglycerides was above normal range and that the Vit D test was missing from the report. I asked the receptionist to locate my Vit D report and she said she is going to give me a call next day. I waited and she never call. I called her and she said she is going to get back to me. It has been 10 days since I talked to her and she never called me back. I am missing a vital part of the test because my Vit D level was low from a previous test. I understand Vit D is very important for my daily health. I got a run around. The doctor or the receptionist never contact me about my high triglycerides and missing test.,,,,,,,no review,,

We played in late December so there was a frost delay but once we got off it was sunny and not very cold. The group in front of us was playing a bit slow from the outset and by the third hole the ranger was on them to speed up (which they did).,,,,,,,no review,,
Course is playable for many skill levels. My group played the tips and are above average golfers and we enjoyed our experience a lot. It was not an overly challenging course but still required skill. Very professionally run course with 3 separate nines (we played Ironhead and Acacia). ,,,,,,,no review,,
Course was in good shape and greens rolled true. Only additional complaint would be that the restaurant was under construction and not open for another month or so and when we went to the only other shop which had food they were out of some different beers and other items (which they had on display and made it seem like they did have them available).,,,,,,,no review,,

Overall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout. Greens in good shape. Course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward. Got out at 8:45 or so and played pretty quickly.

Beer I great though. With the $5 tour you get a small tasting glass and three different tastings. They have the staples along with more seasonal and experimental type brews. Pretty reasonable prices too if you want beers/pitchers also (which you will). Pitchers are generally around $11.,2,IKChsSm17dLG0mTHjFiDLg,,,,,no review,,

Food was amazing! I love seafood and this really hit the spot. The presentation was really nice. Enjoyed every aspect of the meal.  The fried crab was really good - best part of the meal for sure! We also ordered a few extra dishes to complement all the seafood. We ordered a whole chicken which was good - on the smaller side considering you can go across the street to the supermarket to get a similar one for half the price. The mushroom efu noodle was meh - soggy and sticky. This place definitely has their seafood skills down - wouldn't order their other dishes. ,,,,,,,no review,,

Do you want to pay $382.00 for JUST the REAR BRAKES?!?!?!?  If so this is your place!!!,,,,,,,no review,,
I am a mechanic and while on a long distance road trip I needed my rear brakes done.  Since I did not have my tools with me I had no choice.  When dropping off the car I asked for them to retain any parts that were replaced so I could look at them because I know mechanics make their money by replacing parts that don't need to be replaced.  ,,,,,,,no review,,
Guess what???  These buggers did exactly that!!!  They replaced both the rear rotors (discs) that did not need replacing.,,,,,,,no review,,
They said over the phone the rotors mic'ed (micrometer measurement) out less and show .010 less than minimum tolerance  Since I was not there to verify I believed them.,,,,,,,no review,,
When I picked up the car I visually looked at the old rotors and they looked to be turn-able (can be machined to return to serviceable condition).  I pointed out that cast into the rotor is the words  Minimum thickness .072 inches  I asked for their micrometer and mic'ed out the discs and verified that the lowest thickness of the wear on the worst of the two disc was only .78 inches.  The other one was even thicker... so this means that BOTH DISCS were still within tolerance and could be machined.,,,,,,,no review,,
So why did they lie to me when they said the discs were .10 less than minimum tolerance when they were still serviceable?,,,,,,,no review,,
Because they are a RIP OFF and are LI ARS and they take YOUR MONEY by replacing your parts that do not need to be replaced!!!,,,,,,,no review,,

The service was less than mediocre. Brianna who brought our food knocked my sons drink all over him and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. In fact she said she didn't do it when clearly she did if other customers said they saw her do it. It was obvious that there wasn't supervisor presence in the establishment. It's going to take customer service for this place to survive on the strip. You get what you pay for here. Good burgers and no customer service. This proves it is is hard to find good help! I expect more from bobby flay.,2,nLcQKpECIJzjE3VDM7HI_A,,,,,no review,,

- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?,,,,,no review,,
- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.,,,no review,,
- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.,,,,,,no review,,

He didn't show up at the time he gave me and it was like two hours later. 
He was so on rush at the time i was talking to mechanic and he kept saying you killing me man every single minute, as if he is doing a favor to me and it's all free. He ask me for 5$ more after i said i pay by debit card. This is exactly what i experience with him. i give him one star cuz i think he needs to be patient and respect the customer.

But don't let the 'vegetarian' label scare you off, this is just damn good Indian food by any standard.
Our usual order is the aloo paratha (potato bread), masala dosa (dosa stuffed with spicy potato), and the chana masala (chana dal in a liquidy masala sauce with rice). One order of each of those is enough food to stuff two people, for a total of $18.53+tax+tip. Note that's 1 order of each of those, total, not 1 for each person.,,no review,,

Had the traditional chicken shawarma. one of my favourite toppings are the pink pickled radishes. For some reason the ones here were not looking very appetizing. They were old and grey looking. I decided to opt out of those just to be on the safe side. Disappointed that they don't make their own hot sauce like many of the small mom and pop shops - this one was commercial. ,,,,,,,no review,,

 After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. ,,,,,,,no review,,
Most sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10 in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4x6. The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.,2,vuqug_nhr6t_kivibt2xaa,,

First off, it's not a corporate beast. It's a little boutique shop owned by Khadija, an incredibly nice person whose passion for all things tea-related is almost contagious. That feeling of non-corporateness runs throughout the experience at Tea Blendz. Khadija is easily approachable, encourages you to ask questions, and is obviously passionate about the stuff she's selling. Not to say that the staff at those corporate places aren't passionate, but at Tea Blendz, it just seemed more honest.,no review,,
They also have a pretty kick-ass teaspresso machine--one of the only ones in Toronto right now I'm told. Basically, it allows them to quick-press loose-leaf tea rather then steep it. That means you can get it faster and cleaner, and the whole process is under more control of the brewer rather than being at the mercy of the boiling water. Your tea will still take a few minutes, but those few minutes can easily be spent talking to the warm and pleasant staff. In fact, I ended up staying and chatting about tea and the neighbourhood for far longer than those few minutes that my tea was pressed.,,,no review,,
Using the teaspresso machine, Tea Blendz also brews up some pretty amazing tea lattes. Khadija claimed they were the best in the city, and I can't say I'd disagree with her. While I'm self-admittedly not a tea or tea latte expert by any means, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I could definitely see myself going out of my way to enjoy another one.,,,no review,,
Khadija mentioned that there's a growing trend in food and tea pairing. Because of that, I wondered if she planned on offering any food at some point, which right now she doesn't. I don't mean sitting down and eating a club sandwich and fries, but a small, one-bite of something that was specifically made just to be paired with a particular tea would certainly have been interesting. But Tea Blendz just opened a month ago, so things aren't yet set in stone.,,no review,,
All-in-all, I had a great chat with Khadija. I learned some stuff, and I even left with a few bags of tea. I brought home a bag of Chocolate Mint Delight and the Sweet Pumpkin Spice, and at 5 bucks for 50 grams, I left feeling pretty good about buying it.,,,no review,,
So if you're in the neighbourhood, this honest-to-goodness, non-corporate boutique shop is definitely worth checking out and supporting. Even if you're not in the neighbourhood, it's worth the drive if you want to learn more about tea and if you appreciate truly nice customer service.,6,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,,no review,,

Junction Fromagerie is sitting non-coincidentally right next to Delight, a chocolate shop that's perhaps known in the neighbourhood more for their ice cream than their handmade chocolate. Both Delight and Junction Fromagerie are brain-childs of the same people, Jennifer Rashleigh & Jeff Brown, and the association is obvious as far as quality goes. While Delight doesn't have any cheese, they do have a uniquely flavoured and way-better-than-it-sounds Quebec blue cheese ice cream. Soft and creamy with an exacting amount of high-quality blue cheese, it's obviously well crafted and surprisingly tasty.,,no review,,
What makes the Junction Fromagerie different from the handful of other cheese specialty shops in Toronto is their strict direction to Canadian products; they only carry Canadian cheeses, local and artisanal mind you, but Canadian nonetheless. They're also particularly partial to Ontario cheeses. Their in-house made butter, crackers, and croustinis, in conjunction with those small-batch and locally sourced cheeses, make them a worthy underdog in an increasingly competitive business.,no review,,
The Junction Fromagerie brings with it some old-world charm, and at first walk-in, you may mistake it for a boutique fromage on a quiet Paris street. Big-frame bay window and a creaky wood-laid floor set the space. Besides that, the whole store is fairly nondescript other than the front case brightly displaying their cheeses.,,,,no review,,
Don't know your Comtomme from your Bleu de la Moutonndere? No worries! Not only is the staff knowledgeable and the cheese labeled and explained, but the Junction Fromagerie also offers cheese tastings and pairings that not only teach you about the cheese they carry, but also inspire you to be a bit more adventurous in your cheese selections. Although these tastings aren't a regularly occurring event, they do happen. Their Stone's Throw Cheese and WIne Pairing event, which was created with the folks at Stone's Throw Winery, sold out super quick.,,no review,,
The appearance of Junction Fromagerie signals more than just beautiful cheese being available in the Junction. It also serves as an important reminder that when it comes to food, the Junction is fast becoming a neighbourhood that is known for quality.,4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,,,,no review,,

On Thursday around 7:00pm, me and my wife went to the restaurant to have our dinner and we faced the first negative point, the parking lot. The parking lot was not enough to accommodate all the people to the restaurant because it is shared with other stores around. So, it was not hard, but it was easy to notice there was not enough space for everyone. At least, we did not need to wait so much time to sit.,,no review,,
The table was clean, but there was an old newspaper below my table and I noticed that the floor was not totally clean. On a first moment, I thought that the waitress service was nice, but after we placed the order, we got forgotten. My soda glass was empty for a long time and the waitress never comes back asking if I wanted more. But the rolls were delicious, unfortunately, what I cannot say about the Frango no Churrasco and the Bacalhau that me and my wife asked.,no review,,
Overall, it was frustrating for asking the two items that were house specialties and eat a food with poor quality. The Bacalhau was under seasoned and burned plus the potatoes were blend too. My Frango no Churrasco, the chicken was almost very good, the rice and potatoes were almost cold. It seems that the food was released for a time and they forgot there. But the worst for me was having a bad Bacalhau on a Portuguese restaurant. It is a very bad sign. I don't plan to come back again to it and if you are looking for a Portuguese restaurant, I recommend looking for other. There are a plenty around the Greater Toronto Area.,0,95KCaXFJEGla4AK7ETBmWw,no review,,

I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. ,
I went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. ,,,,,,,no review,,
After this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. ,,,,,,,no review,,
Before leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. ,,,,,,,no review,,
Once leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. ,,,,,,no review,,

We had two good experiences with elements, so when we saw a groupon for a four-course tasting menu, we bought it without hesitation.  Side note: our first excellent experience included the tasting menu. He ordered the four course, while I ordered a salad and entree.  His four courses were full of delicious food that was enough to feed us both.  Neither of us were able to finish our meals, and we left full and happy!  But tonight, our tasting menu options and delivery were beyond disappointing.,,no review,,
We decided to sit at the bar tonight.  When we sat down we were eyed down by the female bartender who reluctantly took our order.  She didn't bother to tell us the specials, which we later overheard her share with other customers, and she didn't ask if we were interested in any food.  Before we were finished with our drinks, she brought over our check; were we being rushed out of this NOT crowded bar?  I had a bad feeling, and I wish I would have trusted my gut to leave.  We asked her for another round and let her know we were going to order dinner and had a groupon.,,,no review,,
I'm not even mentioning in detail the bartender's awkward comments that we cleaned our plates during our meal or that another bartender knocked over my glass of wine. Please, don't go to elements.  There are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh to waste anymore thought on this dump.,,,,,,no review,,
Note to restaurants: If you don't like people who use groupons, then please don't invite us into your restaurant only to treat us poorly. Like I said earlier, this was our third visit to Elements.  We bought the groupon because we were repeat customers, we liked the restaurant, and now we will never go back.,,,no review,,

I followed up with Groupon and Elements.  Groupon refunded our money with no problem at all.

I'm a Chicagoan so I've had many many extremely expensive hair services done in the past and Modern Salon is less expensive than what I've had before and offers better service as well. ,
Everyone is very friendly, polite and goes out of their way to assist you. I would recommend Modern Salon to anyone but mostly I would say book with Alisha. She is such a great stylist and a wonderfully warm person as well.,0,8eODUKOnFxal0OAF-vHg3g,,,,no review,,

These were not uncommon responses from folks when I said I'd be heading to Live Food Bar. I too was skeptical but went along for the ride anyways when a friend suggested we go. While perusing the online menu, I was genuinely stumped as to what I would get. I already eat at least one - but generally several - vegetarian meals a week, so I'm not opposed to eating a meal with no meat. But Live is a vegan, organic restaurant that features recipes without gluten, without sugar and certainly without any animal products which is outside my culinary experience. If you happen to feel the same way, I suggest you go with an open mind as Live has an excellent reputation and it is well earned. ,,no review,,
Finally, we made our choices: raw sushi with pumpkin & sunflower seed nori rolls and a detox salad; Bacon Cheese burger; and tempeh cakes with a warm corn, avocado and white wine salsa. Orders placed, we tucked into our wine and the chick pea fries which arrived shortly thereafter. Crispy on the outside, piping hot and soft on the inside, this non-traditional take on a staple hit the spot, especially with the homemade BBQ sauce on the side.,no review,,
Our mains arrived in a timely manner, and we hungrily tucked in to them. The sushi roll had a great combination of flavour and texture. I was a little jealous of not ordering that one for myself, but my giant plate of food was more than enough. The tempeh (an Indonesian soybean product) cakes were piled high on top of the wonderful salsa that was accompanied by a spicy chipotle aioli. If you're hungry, get this dish. It was undoubtedly for the best that I did not order an appetizer, as well as the cakes and sides were so surprisingly good that I was nearly scraping my plate. ,,,no review,,
As for the cheese bacon burger, it passed the taste test. The patty consisted of chick peas and had macadamia cheddar cheese and eggplant bacon. I can see your eyebrows raising. The eggplant had a smoky flavour and was quite good, though certainly not bacon. The cheese in question was a bit of a head-scratcher, though not unpleasant. The gluten-free bun was nicely toasted and the BBQ sauce was a great touch.,,,,no review,,
Since we had already gone through much of the menu, we thought we should give dessert a whirl. All the desserts are kept on display in near the back of the restaurant, and there is quite an array from which to choose. We opted for two: the tiramisu and the Black Forrest cake. Now, my Italian friends would be horrified to find a tiramisu without real cream, but it really was quite good with a strong, but not overpowering, taste of espresso. Similarly,the black forrest cake was rich, creamy and cut nicely with the cherries on top. No complaints - I certainly didn't feel like I was missing out.,
Live has a great vibe to it and customers were constantly arriving either to have a seated meal or to pick up their take-out orders. The music is at just the right volume and the staff is friendly and accommodating. We were there for several hours and never felt rushed, nor got the idea that we were no longer welcome. Food arrives promptly and with a smile, water bottles are refilled, and the service is relaxed. So take your vegetarian friends, take your carnivorous friends: they will likely all be satisfied. The portions are well-sized and, most importantly, the food is delicious.,0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,

One such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the décor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.,,no review,,
My friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.,,,,,no review,,
We submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a Christmas burger the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. ,,,no review,,
Also sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. ,,,,no review,,
No matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!,,,,,no review,,
By the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,no review,,

We met with John at the Gilbert location and he was very patient with us.  We had an idea on our pool design but had no idea at all on costs.  We explained this and he patiently designed our pool and all the bells and whistles.  Obviously it came back way over what we could afford.  But John didn't give us any attitude at all.  We were even in his office right before they were closing and he didn't shoo us out the door.  We ended up taking the quote home and sitting on it for a month.  When we finally came back, John was eager to help us redesign something that we could be proud of.  And we did!!
When our project kicked off, our project manager, David, and John met with us at home and walked us through the entire process.  They even had this cool little website where we could track dates and milestones.  Once it got started, it went very quickly!  Our only delays were because of the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.. and the rain.. oh the rain).  And of course,i had soooo many questions.  david was always very responsive and easy to contact.,,
At the end of our project, we scheduled an appointment with Jason and he walked us through the phone app to control our pool (yep, there's an app for that) and all the controls on our pool system.  He went step by step on the chemicals needed to keep our pool balanced.  After a week of owning our pool, I feel very comfortable being able to maintain our pool myself because of all the information Jason provided us.,9,QkO16gr4QaPaKPWeUTAEqA,,no review,,

Training: Matt, the owner of Romp, instructs all the training classes and we could not be happier with his training with kindness method. There are many ideas about what German Shepherds should be and do act like, but both my boyfriend and I found it truly important to make him the sweetest dog possible. We do not want a robot dog that loses all personality because of training via being broken. Romp exceeds our expectations every time with this regard as, while learning to be obedient for safety and fun, our puppy grows his personality each and every week! It is amazingly spectacular! ,,no review,,
Playtime: Matt's highly professional and super caring staff always make our puppy feel loved and missed every week. It is almost like its his second home here, where all his friends live too. We absolutely love receiving his report cards at the end of each playtime, telling us what his pawsonality, what his favorite activity, who his best friend, and any room of impruffment was that day. FYI...he's a straight A student so never any room for impruffment here, but the staff will let you know if you need to work on something with your dog. Our puppy adores these play sessions and comes back exhausted from his long day of fun. I do have to say that I always speak to Savanna and she is the best! ,no review,,
Grooming: Amanda always makes him look so cute! She really does a terrific job and has over 20 years of experience! What more can you ask for than that? Our German Shepherd puppy is extremely unique that loves being clean and looking his best, but tends to oppose being brushed and groomed at home. Somehow, I still do not know how!, Amanda gets him to not only tolerate these activities, but to want to be brushed and groomed all day long! It is so strange, but I am super grateful to her for her sixth sense!,,no review,,
Every where we go and everyone who interacts with our puppy always says how well behaved and what an outstanding temperament he has and it is in huge part due to Matt and his A team at Romp!,,,,,,,no review,,

What seemed to be a quiet Saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy club like dining experience. And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching,and muchmusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.
I was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new go-to place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox,maybe, but sit we did!,
Putting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.,,no review,,
While I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try Little Tibet further down Queen Street.,0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,,,no review,,
I came here with a large group and we decided to share about 10 dishes among all of us. Really liked the bibimbap! The complementary side dishes was nothing special. But what did stand out was the green pancake/crepe they sent over. So good we ended up ordering another!  ,,,,,,,no review,,

This place would get 5 stars if they expanded their BBQ restaurant. Their ribs are AMAZING. You get SO much food for the price and it tastes sooo good. Plus, the two hour wait isnt always a bad thing because it gives you an excuse to drink and gamble while you wait!,0,msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g,,,,no review,,
Hula Girl isn't just another boring-old coffee shop; they're an 'espresso boutique', and they focus their boutique-ish expertise on blends of Kona coffee beans and turning those blends of beans into near-perfect cups of espresso. The owners are clearly not only passionate about coffee, but knowledgeable about it too; it becomes blatantly obvious with the first sip. The espresso is noticeably balanced and brewed with a high-level of skill. Simply put, they have some truly nice people that are dam good at pulling espressos standing behind their shiny brewing machine.,,,,no review,,
No worries if espresso isn't your thing. They have some of their Kona blends brewed and served as the standard coffee fare too, which is also seriously good. They've got a nice window at the front counter with some baked goods. There isn't much there right now, as I think they've only recently started serving food, but it sure would look good stocked with some interesting, local pastries and deserts.,,,no review,,
Chances are, they'll be busy too. People around here seem to have already shifted their morning-coffee-loyalties over to Hula Girl, and that's a good thing, for Hula Girl and you. Somehow, in this small environment, more people just make it feel cozier, which you'll appreciate. And obviously it's good for Hula Girl because they get to succeed and stick-around,and honestly, there isn't much that's nicer to see succeed than an independent business run by nice people.,
Good on the folks at Hula Girl for opening up on this tired part of Dundas with its old pizza joints and 2 dollar palm reading shops. This street really needed a place like this, and no doubt the people that live there will appreciate it too. Especially among all the artsy stuff that's crept up around here, pizza and palm-readings aside, Hula Girl seems perfectly at home.,,,,no review,,
Like I said, the coffee is spectacular. So if you want some near-perfect espresso made by people that truly know what that means, then Hula Girl should be on your to-do-list; but if you're looking for a place to grab a donut and suck up some free-WiFi, keep walking up the street to The Junction or down the street to Roncys.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,,no review,,

Some notes:,,,,,,,no review,,
-The atmosphere was fun (decor is amazing!),,,,,,,no review,,
-Service was great,,,,,,,no review,,
-Food was creative and delicious,,,,,,,no review,,
-A few dishes were a miss (a noodle soup with the word ugly in the name), but most were spot on. ,,,,,,no review,,
-Mexican food was slightly better than the Chinese, but that makes sense given Jose's backgound. ,,,,,,no review,,
-The salt-air margaritas are genius.,0,Te1y5afUMwaTe62ZiB8Igg,,,,,no review,,
Only downside...the owner of the place was there today, and a bit standoffish.  I wouldn't say rude...but not friendly.  He interrupted my pedicure to have the lady check a yelp review (I'm assuming) because it was regarding a complaint and it was in a different language she could understand.  I didn't mind but it seemed unprofessional.  He kind of was staring at me, so I just said hello and he ignored me. :/ I would have given it five stars.  However, I work in an office, and a lot of ladies ask about my nails since I'm constantly working with my hands, and I will recommend this place and Christina!,1,rr4nrgrl3jvjpddsz4__pa,,
Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard,are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.
The brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.,,,,,,no review,,
The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.,,,,,no review,,
The thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.,,no review,,
People rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.,no review,,
Make no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West,they may not be doing as well as they are now.,,
So would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.,7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,,,,no review,,

3751,xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,0,2016-01-19,0,M4ql7C-LLXQLA9TvUexgUw,5,tonight my husband and i visited cleveland tiffin and we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience.  before i get into sharing about the food, I must express how friendly and personable Anup and everyone at Tiffin were.  While waiting for our food, Anup shared fascinating information about Tiffin Carriers in India.  I will continue to learn more about this process on my own.
     Now on to the dinner,  I am vegan so I ordered the Palak Paneer and traded out the paneer for tofu extra spicy.  I also ordered Vegetable Biryani extra spicy.   This was a delicious meal.  The spinach and tofu was so flavorful and fresh and the Biryani was aromatic and addictive.  My husband orders the Chicken Tika Masla.  He also enjoyed his dish as well.  The portions are large so I have a lot of food left over to eat.  All dishes are made to order...like a homemade meal.  With that in mind, prepare to order a couple of hours before you plan to eat dinner.  It is definitely worth the wait.,0,MONB2_AEZ8mkROhjEycJaA,,,no review,,
1679,PycR_Mr5jA9jB4Xg3nX0Yw,1,2015-03-14,1,K1u4tBI8-GCc7P_Ra2lmLg,1,this is the worst rental car company i've ever dealt with.  not only did we have to wait for an hour and a half in line to pick up the rental car, but the company added on a additional charges for fuel (even though I filled the tank full within a few miles of the rental car return) as well as late return fees.  ,
We had returned our vehicle on time according to the rental agreement, and when we did, their system was down.  We asked for a receipt or something showing the car was returned on time and they told us they couldn't provide anything.  When the final charge came in, they added on a late return charge and printed the receipt after their system was back up.  ,,,,no review,,
I will never use this company again and I recommend you avoid them too.  The price is initially low when you reserve a car, but they add on false charges afterward.,14,mBpRrVzcUsLViA1r4Cua1Q,,,,no review,,

From walking by, it doesn't look like the greatest place, but they have an interesting menu with different asian/asian fusion dishes so there's a little bit for everyone from the exotic to the simple.,,,,,no review,,
The Malaysian Sate, which I had with beef, was delicious and came in a more than adequately sized portion. The Pad Thai is also a delicious meal. All of the appetizers and other dishes I tried were more than satisfactory. ,,,,,no review,,

First, a few fun facts:,,,,,,no review,,
- The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013 ,,,,,,no review,,
- Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide! ,,,,,,no review,,
- The NOBU Hotel, a boutique hotel which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first NOBU Hotel ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)  ,,,no review,,
Now, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall,the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.,
Now, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!,,,,,no review,,
1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!),,,,,,,no review,,
six (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking should I order another round now or later? as they are finishing off this one ;) ,,,,no review,,
2) Black Cod w/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!),,,,,,,no review,,
So succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't pass on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :) ,,,,no review,,
3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!),,,,,,,no review,,
This comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, las vegas, and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their own trio :) It was super fresh n delicious! ,,,no review,,
4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!),,,,,,,no review,,
OK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces. ,,no review,,
5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16,,,,,,,no review,,
This was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle... ,,,,,,,no review,,
6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14,,,,,,,no review,,
If you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!,,,,,no review,,
Dessert,,,,,,,no review,,
We went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15,,,,,,,no review,,
Flourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience. ,,,,no review,,

We made reservations for a party of 4 on a Saturday night. Good thing too because the place was packed! I've actually tried to get in to this restaurant without reservations and been turned away because it's so busy. ,,,,,,,no review,,
The restaurant itself is nicely appointed. We were seated in the back at a cute little booth, allowing us to look out at the whole of the restaurant. ,,,,,,no review,,
The service was friendly but a bit slow at times. It seemed that any time we wanted to order (drinks, entrees, and dessert), we had to wait for a fairly long time for our server to notice us. However cleaning up plates was very efficient. ,,,,no review,,
We also had problems with the restaurant running out of items we wanted. One person in the party ordered their ravioli and was told upon ordering that they were out of it. It really bothers me when restaurants don't tell you up front what they don't have in stock anymore. Otherwise you are happy with your choice and then need to make a split decision because the restaurant doesn't have it.  Two of us were also drinking Coke Zero and they ran out of that half way through the meal too. ,,,,,,,no review,,
In terms of the food, I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and remember the food being better than this visit. I had the wild cheese tortellini and found it to be a bit bland. My husband had the bolognese which I also found to be a bit bland. The bruschetta was delicious and the tartufo was good as well so it was just the pasta sauces that could have used a bit more salt, or extra oomph. ,,,,,no review,,
Comparing this restaurant to Michael's Back Door on Lakeshore, I'd prefer Michael's Back Door.,2,mfCYP8z56MdjaopG_zbbRw,,,,no review,,

The croissants are ridiculously flaky, the magic squares are incredible as usual, I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I've sort of come to expect that anything from APiecalypse Now! will be really good.,,,,no review,,

I find this highly offense and unprofessional, it makes me extremely uncomfortable and I also wonder what comments he has made about my body sexually.,no review,,
A couple bad apples can surely affect business, I know I avoid going to this establishment on certain days due to those specific employees. I have even mentioned something to the General Manager who simply replied, That is just who they are., with a smile on her face, like it wasn't a big deal and walked away. I was highly shocked, but with her attitude and lack of concern for the company, explains why those couple people act the way they do.,1,CwVG-QYRdufyMH_oPPH85w,

I've had the poutine several times over the past two years or so and it's just right (in my opinion; your poutine preferences may vary). A good amount of fresh cheese curds, the fries aren't cut too thick or too thin, and the gravy's not too dark and heavy like at some other places I've eaten. The price is right -- I believe the small poutine (which for me is a generous enough serving) and can of pop I usually get is $9.,,,,,no review,,

I took the Basic Sewing Essentials class on a whim, and now I can't wait to take more. The classes are small (just 6 people) and easy to follow. The instructor was helpful, with good advice on troubleshooting machine problems, threading issues, and other sewing machine stuff. I left feeling like I had learned something that I could actually do again without  being confused. Karyn, the owner, was our instructor and came around regularly to check on everyone and offer help or advice.,no review,,

After paid, I direct myself to the food delivery station and noticed something that I never noticed on the other restaurants on the USA side.

It incentives the staff to have always a better performance.,,,,,,no review,,
Overall, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious like always, but I did not like so much the salad. Different than on USA, I found big chunks of lettuces instead of in small pieces like the other restaurants.

It was my first trip to Las Vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress. By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.,,,,,,no review,,
We were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.,no review,,
Service was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or over-styling. Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.,,,no review,,
I'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.,,,,,no review,,

You are pretty safe ordering most of the items on the menus, except for the mushroom soup. I was under the impression that it was a cream of mushroom soup, but it was far from what I had expected. It was more sour and strange, so I couldn't finish it. Before I ordered, I did ask to confirm that it was cream of mushroom soup, but upon tasting, I think that it had more of a wine base than cream base. Maybe my taste buds are not refined enough,and the soup is actually good? i'm not sure.,0,hJulW1s6tOBr2NXD9nAoMQ

177,5PO5ZIHIcaTNIiHNoRKDqg,0,2012-06-21,1,r13Q1UVbPED1I-RRsbJDgw,1,the kensington cornerstone offers a gluten free menu.  it has gluten free beer.  it has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  i chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  it checked a lot of boxes on my list.  i won't be going back.,,
This past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.,,,,,no review,,
It was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. ,,,no review,,
Just when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and/or mojitos, and/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer,so i was looking forward to trying a new one.  i asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.,
When our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.,,,no review,,
So by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. ,,,no review,,
(Sound of clock ticking),,,,,,,no review,,
Another half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy,but you should still be able to pick it up.,,
My mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.,,,,no review,,
Looking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. ,,,no review,,
After we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.,1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,,,no review,,

It's not just diversity that makes this a kick-ass experience, the food is also spectacular and truly imaginative.

It's a genuinely nice blend of the expected and the unexpected. As a side note, I need to mention the impressive veggie burger they've got that's made from black beans and served with a wild mushroom saute and caramelized onions. Spectacular.

So, let me start with the sides. We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25,i'm very disappointed.,,
Now, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl. ,,,no review,,
On to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here,nothing; just pure steak goodness. it was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered. 
Overview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks). Though the steaks and bisque were great, the sides were eerily reminiscent of my grandmothers (terrible) cooking. I think Craftsteak is a poor value for your buck, therefore I'll give it 3/5 - A-OK.,0,mFBIF-EQ8OdLw15rzFf1sw,,no review,,

And I've found the service to be great on both occasions I've visited the restaurant.  Prompt attention but not so much that it becomes hovering.  Plus the place has a beautiful bar area that's great for a relaxed dinner.,0,X-IK7d1JIKVPWhgeiPO3pA,,,,,no review,,

Charcuterie Platter ($16 small/$25 large) & Thuet Bread ($2 small/$4 large,,,,,,,no review,,
)This is a wonderful introduction for those who have never tried charcuterie. Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.,,,,,no review,,
All offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.,,,,,no review,,
The star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.,,,,,,no review,,
Roasted Bone Marrow ($9),,,,,,,no review,,
Hollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.,,,no review,,
Tongue in Brioche ($13),,,,,,,no review,,
The sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.,,,,,no review,,
Incredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.,,,,,no review,,
Raw Horse Sammy w/ Hot Sauce ($22),,,,,,,no review,,
Fresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The HORSE spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.,,,,,,no review,,

Crispy Pig Ear Salad,,,,,,,no review,,
Strips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing,,,,,no review,,
I liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.,,,,no review,,
The pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...,,,,,,no review,,
Fluke Crudo,,,,,,,no review,,
Fluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.,,,no review,,
I really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :),,,,,,no review,,
N'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle,,,,,,,no review,,
House tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.,,,,,no review,,
Mmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!,,,,no review,,
Pork Belly, Squid,& Melon,,,,,no review,,
Baby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.,,no review,,
While the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.,,,,no review,,
Calf's Brain Ravioli,,,,,,,no review,,
House ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings,,,,,no review,,
So...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =),no review,,

Apparently this service advisor thought I wouldn't know this, as most people wouldn't, I'm sure.  When I asked him again what part it was they had to go get from a parts store, giving him the chance to be honest with me, he lied again.  Therefore, I presented him with this information and he instantly turned quite sheepish, not knowing what to say.  I proceeded to tell him that all we wanted was some honesty and they obviously don't deliver that at this dealership.  My wife and I walked away and he had nothing to say.,no review,,
Case and point: NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.,4,f59f2MbYILQznPvc9iBDog,,,,,no review,,
Ambiance was okay - a predilection to play music a tad too loud like many restos catering to the young professional sensibility, which I don't get, but it seems the trendy thing to do.  Attracts annoying overpaid hipster patrons as well - the table next to us was a clamorous sea of forgettable vapid single women in their 30s that would repeatedly rupture into a crescendo of squeals: this song is about me! or I know the chef, ladies I know the chef - WHY ISN'T ANYBODY LISTENING TO ME? or Tamara is a super betch or new girl sits down at table, prompting sounds that could etch glass, despite it being said Tamara.  Etcetera.  If it wasn't for our neighbours, the entire experience would have been ethereally sublime.,no review,,
We had the table closest to the door, it was winter, and it was crazy cold sitting there.  Don't sit there.  Still, despite being a complainer and loving all things complainy: 5 stars, hands down one of the more memorable culinary experiences I've had in the city.  Don't miss it, and book way in advance.,0,fsumorfhg2rwe7rx8uymmq,,

I went to see Beth and told her that I was looking for a slightly different style since I was bored with what I'd been doing for so long. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure what kind of style she gave me. It ended up looking very choppy in the back - two very drastic layers with no texturing - and then an A-line cut which looked a little goofy since I have shoulder length hair.,,,,,,no review,,
I ended up going to Cassie at Salon G (just down the road) and she fixed my cut and I love it now.,0,2tOHlIE3sTntIX5DiE3l4w,,,,,no review,,

Perhaps it's because I'm from Boston, so I'm spoiled when it comes to fresh seafood, but I found it difficult to find any appetizing seafood here.,,,,,no review,,
I started with the crab legs, which weren't bad, but were a bit stringy. I moved onto the cajan shrimp and calamari.. The shrimp wasn't edible, beyond fishy(YUCK!), the calamari was passable. Finally I made it to the lobster tails... ummm... I've had lobster countless times, I wouldn't call these lobster tails. They had a greyish tint, tasted like rubber,and left a very unsettling feeling in my stomach.,,
Again, perhaps I'm spoiled by the fresh seafood of the east coast, or perhaps I was perturbed to have paid for a buffet of buffet pass, and paid an additional $15 for this seafood travesty, but I will not be back.,5,cwmozH0btTWP1a84TLoSJQ,no review,,

Nothing unusually striking with my chicken dish.  The flavor was quite acceptable and portion size was good.  My companion didn't have any complaints about the curry dish, and she even brought home the leftovers.  Dessert consisted of two pieces of fried banana and a scoop of coconut ice cream.  Both were quite appealing, though I accidentally got some of the fried banana syrup on my finger.  The syrup was incredibly sticky and I had to wash it off at a sink as merely using a napkin was not enough.,,,,,no review,,
The dining area is small (under 10 tables), and the service was excellent.  I did not see a picture of the Thai king on the wall, which to my understanding every Thai restuarant ought to have.

I waws there a few nights ago and had the spaghetti and meatballs.  My wife had the spinach pie.  It took a good while for someone to recognize we were there - but after that it was fine.  In fact, our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and had great descriptions of the meals.  However, the food was just ok - not to say he over promised, he didn't.  The food was just ordinary.  The meatballs were a little overcooked and the sauce was average.  I did try my wife's spinach pie and it was simply spankopita in huge portion.  ,,,,no review,,

Let's start with the drinks - they have an excellent beer selection, including fat tire which is one of my favorites.  Pitcher for $22 = very happy me.,,,,,,no review,,
Their burgers were cooked to perfection and included fresh, very tasty ingrediants that matched some of the other upscale burger places I've been - like Five Napkin in Manhatten.  I had the Black Jack Burger, which I can attest was fantastic.  My friends also enjoyed the American Classic, Black Angus Beef and Original Ultimate Burgers.,,,,no review,,
As far as sides, I tried their sweet potato fries as others on Yelp have said they are fantastic - I thought they were good but nothing special.  If I were to go back and I would probably go with regular fries.,,,,,,no review,,

I got there way too early, but the moment I walked in, I instantly felt comfortable and welcome. It's the kind of place I could see myself visiting everyday for a coffee. Very friendly atmosphere, the lighting was great, and there was ample seating (but of course,  it was 10am on a Saturday morning). It was obvious this was a local spot, people coming in and out,chatting with bob (the owner) like he was an old friend.,,
I ordered my usual large soy latte. It was so good. Thick, with a cute three dimensional heart made of crema. And I just loved the cup. I commented on it in my head and then again to Nicole H when she got there. It was the perfect size and shape to hold with both of my hands. Also, I was very happy to see they don't charge extra for soy milk!,,,,,no review,,

Seriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.,,,,no review,,
First off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful,crappy food. in a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.,
I ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.,,no review,,
Speaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.,,no review,,
The seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.,,,,no review,,
Sitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.,,,no review,,
Although we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark,the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.,,
On the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.,no review,,
O.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...,15,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,,,,,no review,,

As for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like did you want soup?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!

We sat in the bar area and weren't greeted for about 15-20mins. No big deal, we order our drinks and that takes about another 15 mins to arrive. The server brings drinks to the table next to us and drops the entire tray of drinks and the lady behind me... I'm not talking a little water. The poor lady is covered in drinks. The server immediately apologies and runs off leaving the spilled drinks all over the floor and table. I kid you not that spilled mess sat on the floor for 30 mins before ANYONE came over.

Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies,didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.,
Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland,both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.',
As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.,,,,,no review,,

But you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount you're paying.  The all you can eat is around $25 / person & everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).,,,,,,,no review,,

The indoor pool area is great, with shower facilities and a locker room that are clean and a good temperature for freezing kids getting out of the pool.  The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.,,,no review,,

She said 'I'm a hairdresser,' and instantly my connection with Christian was born. 
I have just read the other stellar reviews of Christian on this site, and found myself nodding and smiling in agreement with all of them. I will add that I have never in my life had a hairdresser who was so caring and concerned about understanding what I want for my hair, then working to give it to me and 'get it right.' Christian is a beautiful person, inside and out, and I feel as if my appoinments with her are also  visits with a friend. ,,,no review,,
Not to mention that she is a kick-ass, super-talented stylist and my hair has never looked better!

They're great with coupons; you'll almost never pay full price for a haircut.  This explains why I got my haircut there so many times.  Each visit was more bizarre than the time before.  The last time that I went to Dean's, two of the stylists lectured me on the 'bad' product that I used on my hair (a bumble and bumble product...).  
Overall, my haircuts were never good.  Mehh at best.  I've been to three different stylists there and only one of them spoke to me while cutting my hair.  That can be an awkward hour long hair cut... And the salon is dirty.  Maybe my standards are too high, but if I'm getting my eyebrows waxed, I believe that the hair should be wiped off of the chair.  Or that there shouldn't be noticeable dust bunnies all over the salon.

Ever since they got fixed locations though, I am very unimpressed.  I have slight hearing loss and the environment in this place is not conducive to any form of conversation - the music is all rap and hip hop and seriously and intensely loud.  I don't mind the style of music at all and am happy to eat tacos to A Tribe Called Quest, but at airplane-taking-off decibel levels? I was with a group and couldn't hear a word of what was being said, made me feel stupid and isolated.  Asking for music to be turned down was disregarded - 'this is our brand' was what I got in return.  Gross.  Service was slow and weirdly pretentious given the aesthetic they are trying to cultivate.,,,,no review,,
As per the tacos - overpriced and way small.  No lies, the cod fish is a decent two bites, but the carnita, cotija and beef cheek taste very boring - like more boring than ground beef with a 99 cent taco mix packet boring.  You could eat ten of them easily and still be hungry, which sets you back over $60 - the price/food ratio is rough and both times I left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.,no review,,
The cherry on top is that this place is run by misogynists who think it is funny to make taco puns at the expense of women.  They have done this multiple times, and I am certain will continue to do so despite overtures to the public.  But hey, it's just locker room talk, right? ,,,,no review,,

A former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.,,,,,no review,,
Inside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...,no review,,
This restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.,,,no review,,
Well to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.,,,,no review,,
A variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflé of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.,,,,no review,,
One benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.,,,,,,,no review,,
Quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it.

These are similar to tapioca / bubble tea balls / boba except they are flavored (mango, passion fruit, etc) juice surrounded with a thin coating. These things POP in your mouth. They are great, everyone should try them out. ,,,,no review,,
They offer many different flavors of frozen yogurt (~roughly 5-6: green tea, pomegranate, plain, strawberry, taro, and some others),,no review,,

When ordering burgers, the first selections that we made were not available so I settled on a Bison Burger. It was not much to speak of from the bun to the toppings or even the meat itself. It wasn't memorable or particularly tasty. The french fries I tried seemed overdone and like they had been sitting out.,,,,,,no review,,
Frankly. I would not recommend this place. My meal left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. The food was not that good and the service also left something to be desired. The restaurant was a little dark, uncomfortable booths, and didn't have a nice atmosphere.... If you're in the area, you'd be better off at Red Robin,,0,djSJ6a9gsLSdj-7BoyNNQA,no review,,

The hotel is under renovation too so don't expect the famed Ritz service for the medium future.
Ok next night gets even better we arrive back at 10.30 and guess what ... bar closed. No problem we order drinks in our room and they send us Macaroni and Cheese!,,,,,,,no review,,

Two of my favorite special foods in one perfect omelette. 
I arrived at what must be one of their busiest times, and after some initial confusion as to who was lining up for take out and who was lining up to be seated I joined the correct line and waited only about 4-5 mins before a very pleasant hostess greeted me. ,,,,,,no review,,
I was on my own and was seated immediately at a lovely, comfortable corner booth/table. Guessing they would be too busy to make it to me quickly I put my coffee order in with her. By the time I returned from the bathroom (v well kept!) a server was bringing my coffee order. ,,,,,,no review,,
I had had a chance to review the menu while waiting and put my order in immediately.  The male server was friendly and efficient and I was left to my own devices to wait for my food. I watched the staff moving back and forth in this small establishment with ease and dexterity realizing they had a well oiled machine! I looked around and appreciated the simple decor was very clean & well maintained. ,,,,,,,no review,,
My server came over with more coffee apologizing for the delay (a party of 6 had been seated just before me, but after he returned to my table with more cream another server brought my dish out! (Also apologizing) I should note that I did not feel like I had been waiting long at all. ,,,,,,no review,,
It was beautifully plated with a very fresh spinach and mixed greens salad and the gorgeous, thick balsamic dressing in a tiny metal dispenser on the side. My choice of toast was also served up, perfectly toasted and buttered just slightly so as to also enjoy a side of jam. ,,,,,no review,,

This is their newest location. They had been open a few weeks when I visited with a large group of friends. The good news is they were able to accommodate the large party on short notice. The staff were polite, but because it was so busy they were not as attentive as I would have liked. We had to make several requests for garnishes, drinks and cutlery. ,,,,,no review,,
The nightmare came when it came time to order. You had to navigate yourself through the crowds of people to the other side of the restaurant to place your order. They had so many staff around I don't understand why they don't have table service. The nightmare continued when the food took over 45 minutes for everyone to receive their food. Some orders came within 15 minutes, others took up to 45 minutes. By the time the last people received their food the first group of people already finish their dinners. ,,,,,,no review,,
I was one of the first ones to receive their dinner but it was cold. The beef was very tough - couldn't stab it with a fork and had to use my hands. The rice was quite bland and the salad wilted. I also tried the butter chicken pizza which was ok. Mixed reviews from the other people we were dining with as well - the grilled chicken was good as was the other barbecued items. some of the other pizzas that they had tried we're also just okay. One of the only highlights was the pita bread that was brought to our table when we arrived - it was piping hot. ,,,,,,,no review,,
Maybe it's just growing pains. I will give another location a second chance.,2,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ,,,,,no review,,
They also have these super tasty canned Hawaiian beverages at the counter that we both highly recommend.  ,,,,,,,no review,,
Oh, and if you have a smaller appetite, definitely go for the smaller plate option.  My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach and I can never finish the full-sized katsu plate, but the smaller one is just right (actually still a little more than I can eat, usually) and it's only about $5.

No reservations are accepted, so if you go on a Fri or Sat night, be prepared to have a few cocktails at the bar.,,,,,no review,,
Also, if you are a fan of chains like Mad Mex or Don Pablos, I wouldn't recommend trying Azul. You will come out of this place saying the prices are too high and the portions are too small. ,,,,,no review,,

Find a place that cares about your big day as much as you do. Superstition Manor only wants your money, and they aren't even willing to work that hard for it. Really pathetic experiences the more we got to know them. 
We spent a lot of money and made our wedding look good, but still got treated poorly, and worse our guests were treated poorly. It was like we worked for them and not the other way around. A $10K or even $20K+ event shouldn't be a DIY experience in which the staff is rude and a hinderance to pulling off the day the bride dreams of.,,,,,no review,,

 I was referred here by a friend and at first thought Korean and Mexican?? WEIRD... i dont know... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.,,,,,,no review,,

The food last night was decent, but I do think I could have made it at home with Jamie Oliver's Italian cook book. It's not too expensive, however, so long as you moderate your alcohol, which justifies going there. It can also be fun, with the nod to the retro decor and interesting hipster patrons an staff. Our hostess was great and the waitress not so good (didn't ask how things were until the meal was almost done, didn't ask me if I wanted another drink,etc.).,,
The rustic style pizzas do remind me more of true Italian pizza than one would normally expect of a North American pizza joint. The name Magpie, after the bird, is a very commonwealth reference, which may seem odd at first. It is, however, one of a number of restaurants with British references that have opened in the past year or so in Montreal: e.g. Sparrow, Lawrence,brit & chips, the Burgundy Lion, etc. 
All in all, I will go back, but with moderate expectations.,5,rC7r9GvfBm_hk3QA0_vJDQ,,,no review,,

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.,no review,,

4851,Yemfgx9S_UzK9Rbqpbl6nA,1,2013-08-20,3,lr5blFSZWDqTLHuSyQtmsA,1,my husband and i found this business at the arizona home show.  the owner was very nice and the company was licensed and bonded so we thought we were in good hands.  we had the owner come and look at our brand new home and give us an estimate of painting the inside of our home.  the price was reasonable and being that we found this company at the home show and because the company was licensed and bonded we hired them to do the job.  we were told the job would take 4 days and we checked on the progress every day.  again this is our brand new never lived in home, on the last day of painting we checked on the progress only to find the painting was completed along with major damage to our brand new shower.  The owner did not call us when the damage occured and when we contacted him he fessed up and apologized that one of his workers had fallen off a ladder and broke an entire slab of stone in our shower and promised to take care of the damage.  When we asked why we were not told when it happened the owner said he was trying to come up with a solution first.  Seemed odd to us we werent told immediately but let it go.  We then had to get the original stone installers to our new home for an estimate and provided the estimate to the painter.  The owner of the company did send us a check for the difference of what we owed him and the damage to our stone which is still not yet fixed as it had to be ordered so we have been without a shower now for over two weeks.,
We thought this would all be behind us and that it was just an unfortunate accident that wasnt handled very well.  That was until we found further damage to the outside of our home.  It was obvious more damage was done by the companies workers!  They had dragged a pallet of paint from our gate to our back door in our backyard.  The pallet was left in our backyard and we were able to trace the lines the pallet made all the way to its last ending point.  Based on the tracks it appears the workers pushed the pallet around the corner of our house and pulled so hard it removed the stucco and paint from the side of our BRAND NEW house.  ,,,,,,,no review,,
I was never advised of this damage either and when we emailed the owner of the company we never received a response.  We are beyond dissatisfied with this company based on the damage they did to our home not once, but twice and how it was handled.  We have never written a review on a company before and have never been so dissatisfied and wanted to warn others of our experience with this company.

If you have a group, make reservations because otherwise you'll be packed into a corner sharing a table with 2 or 3 people. 
Waffles and crepes were really good. I had a waffle topped with fruit and a scoop of their vanilla ice cream (which I heard was made in house, not commercial brand). Very good! My friend has the crepe with chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce - also very good!,,,,,,no review,,
Another occasion we had the hot chocolate with a slice of chocolate cake. Hot chocolate was really good. The cake slice was huge. I feel that they could reduce the price (which was pricy as is!) and serve a smaller portion. This is definitely a share sized piece of cake - but you're stuck with just one variety if you're with a date. Table beside us had a group of 3 who ordered 3 slices and left about half of their cake behind. ,,,,,,,no review,,

Their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff you'd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless. Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches. They also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in that's worth mentioning. The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.,,,,,no review,,

We were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.

We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.,no review,,
My favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than restaurant-y, for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.,,,,no review,,
As we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.

133,iVCx91Wrn-CjpxJAyLHPxg,2,2011-01-03,0,4T3tLnPK6MntQAPVItIEFg,2,having grown up enjoying pubs far and wide, it doesn't take much to cajole me into visiting the newest local for a pint and bite to eat. This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.,
Axis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.,,,,,,no review,,
Arriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.,,,,no review,,
Within seconds we were greeted by the two servers/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.,,,,,,,no review,,
Taking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.,,,,,no review,,
Perusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.,,,,,,no review,,
At the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared,but again not remarkable. combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.
Overall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,,,no review,,

Rowing is an incredible total body workout that quickly improves your performance in all athletic activities.  When I finally started running again, I was surprised that I was doing better than before my injury! I would never have stuck with it and developed this appreciation if it wasn't for Morten. I can't imagine a more knowledgeable and devoted rowing coach- an opinion shared by every student I've met in his classes.,,,,,,no review,,
Since joining I've added spinning, boot camp and yoga to the list of classes I regularly attend. The schedule is perfect for me (early mornings, but there are evening classes as well) and I always look forward to starting my day with this group. Taking a spin or boot camp class from Linda is fun and inspiring.  She accomplishes an unbelievable amount every day, but nothing ever weakens her contagious passion for fitness.  The community of members is great too, and there are always opportunities to join others for local events like races.,,,no review,,
As a person used to just getting up and running for my exercise, I never thought I would want or need to join a gym. But I am so happy I did. At Class Fitness I've found friendship, accountability, and new adventures!,0,13pXNVZXCLJMdTa9BcofDA,,no review,,

128,Uw-kIS3HTuAohfg0edQZ3Q,2,2010-12-08,0,ZXfIARFQ5sKpO0IEdc9qlw,3,joy bistro is a beautiful, sophisticated resto just inside Leslieville on Toronto's East side. It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.
First things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues,joy bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.,,
Brunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.,no review,,
That, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.,no review,,
They've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?,no review,,
Despite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,no review,,

Their menu features a wide variety of dishes - mostly typical Korean fare. However, people usually go for their cold noodles. They also feature an extensive list of Sundae (soon-deh) dishes, which is Korean sausage made with pig organs and intestines. Observing the other tables, I noted that it wasn't as popular as Naeng Myeon. However, keep in mind that it was a hot summer evening and the cold noodles are just that good. I personally like Sundae (spelling it like that is making me want ice cream...argh. I better switch to Soondae), and encourage you to try it!,,no review,,

This was perfect for the hot day. The slushy broth, cooling veggies, chilled arrowroot noodles, and sliced hard-boiled egg made this the most satisfying bowl of noodles that I've had in Toronto. I chowed until all that was left was a puddle of the special spicy sauce which I loved. From what I observed, it's essentially hot pepper paste (gochu-jang), hot pepper flakes, and probably a bit of soy & minced garlic.,no review,,
The slurried broth kept the dish chilled while I ate through my mother's plate of Tang Soo Yuk. My father and I shared dumplings & short ribs.,,,,,,,no review,,
Anyways, I can quite honestly say that this was the best bowl of cold noodles that I've had to date, rivalling South Korea. While it may seem backwards to eat spicy food when it's hot, it was super satisfying and it didn't make me feel hotter at all.,,,,no review,,
Not a fan of spicy food? They offer Mul Naeng Myeon, which is essentially the same thing but without the spicy sauce (but that's what makes this so good, so please...get the bibim!!). It comes with seasonal fruit - watermelon was being served tonight. I like watermelon, but I love spice.,,,,no review,,

A childhood favourite of mine, this is an example of Korean-style Chinese cuisine.

Sticky-sweet, when it's done right the deep-fried pork, chicken, or beef has super crispy batter and is tender on the inside with a generous helping of sugary syrup, vegetables and fruit. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was squishy,not crispy, which pretty much ruined the dish. Boo.,

I was a little frustrated with the service, but it was super-busy so I wasn't upset. The servers were rushing between tables, so they definitely weren't slacking. I was simply anxious to get my banchan because I was super hungry and jealously watching other tables get theirs while we were a little forgotten...even though we were right in front of the kitchen. Oddly, we received our mandu (dumplings) and kalbi (short ribs) before our banchan but again, they were under quite a bit of pressure so I didn't complain. We were also not given a box of cutlery, and it was hard to wave a server down. Needing something to eat the food on our table, I leaned over and swiped a box from another table.,no review,,

Another rep showed us several cars  to choose from and answered our questions with patience and professionalism.  Returning the car was just as easy.
I removed one star because the rep made a point of emphasizing that Arizona is a no-fault state and we'd be liable for lost use of the car if it landed in the shop, regardless of whether the other driver was at fault.  With over $200 in added insurance and a $10 a day upgrade, our original weekly rental of $197 burgeoned into well over $525.  ,,,,,no review,,

We bought an $84K fifth-wheel from this place and we had a horrible experience starting from the receptionist all the way to the general manager. The sales staff is a joke. They are lazy, unprofessional, smokers and drunks. They think they are too good (arrogant). The management is a bunch of shady, incompetent liars. They shift the blame onto their subordinates, or they make you sound as if you are the one who is wrong or mistaken.,,,no review,,
The service department is just as bad. They tell you that they have fixed/repaired the parts, but when you get it home, nothing works properly. They also keep your trailer for weeks at a time, so if you plan on using it, good luck getting it back on time for your next trip. ,,,no review,,

I liked them all - the lemonade was the most refreshing for the hot day, but I enjoyed the banana-chocolate- jalpeno flavour the most. With a consistency that's more shake-y than juice-y (makes sense given the ingredients), I enjoyed a jalapeño bite after each chocolately slurp. I wish they used a darker chocolate instead though - I think that the stronger cacao taste would go really well with the jalapeño.,,,,,no review,,

The black bean dip with avocado was also tasty with the red tortilla chips. Dense and chunky, the bowl was spooned clean.

In hindsight, I think I would've liked this in the sandwich too!,,,,no review,,
Julies' Pies!,,,,,,,no review,,
Ooh...pie. With Wanda's Pie in the Sky down the street I was surprised to see Julies' Pie for dessert. I racked my poor memory for a bakery named Julie's and drawing a blank, I asked where/who Julie('s) is. It turns out that one of the owner's (Ryan) cousin's wife bakes yummy desserts for their cafe. Talk about family love :) It was a sweltering hot day, but he convinced me that the pie was reaaaalllly good with a knowing omg look on his face. Not that my sweet tooth ever needs much convincing anyways.,,,,,no review,,
And reaaaallly good it was! Totally catering to my not-so-secret love affair with Ontario peaches, the filling was just the right amount of sweet and the crust (which I think is just as important!) was nice and soft. While my friend said he would've preferred more of a bite for both the peaches and the crust, I was quite satisfied as I liked the super-soft pieces of fruit. Mmmm. It wasn't syrupy or overloaded with sugar. This pie-lover was satisfied.,,,,,no review,,
The service from co-owner Chris was very friendly and conversational. I heard they were going to offer fish tacos at yesterday's Pedestrian Sundays however a combination of a precarious weather forecast and something about the cousin who was going to cook 'em up made it a no-go. I must have looked crest-fallen as I got a consoling tap on the shoulder from Ryan (is it creepy that I'm using their first names as if I know them?) and a promise of their appearance on August 29th's Pedestrian Sunday. Sadly I will be out of town, but as a fanatic of Little Italy's Fish Store, at least I know where to get my fish-fix. Pout.,,,,,no review,,
Overall, I had a good time at The Bellevue. While there were some things that I would like to tweak, everything tasted good and homey.

Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.

It took me about 40 minutes on the Queen streetcar  to get here after work... but it was worth it. Since it was the end of the day, they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats (even after apparently baking 3 day's worth of things) but I grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting, a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and a gluten free butter tart (and a non gluten free butter tart). They were all delicious. The cupcake was spongy and fluffy, the icing sweet, whipped, and not stiff at all. I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.,no review,,
Friendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it.

As far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that. It always has intriguing items that are not what you would expect to find just anywhere. I have personally not made a purchase yet, but my colleague and I went to 3rd Thursday and she bought a door for $5!!! There is not even where to have lunch for that price! Miles gave her helpful suggestions as to how to recreate the door into a unique piece of art with either using pictures and turning it into a giant frame or using it as a room divider. Pretty cool!!!

To start, we met at Mandalay's House of Blues.  The House of Blues was the first stop. We went in for about 15 minutes then walked to the second location which was the Foundation room also located at Mandalay hotel. After that, our tour director (lol) walked us to the third club L.A.X(Luxor).  By then our feet hurt from all the walking so no one went inside the club. We sat outside the club until it was time for the next destination. If we had known this was a club walk, we would have worn walking shoes. ,,,,no review,,
Following LAX , we finally got on the over booked party bus (There were not enough seat). Luckily two individuals decided to abandon the field trip after walking to LAX. Anyway, the fun began on the bus where we were served watered down premixed drinks. We danced and got a little wild until rain water started leaking into the bus from the overhead emergency exit. The Party host did seem to care that we were getting rained on. ,,,,,no review,,
Due to the rain, we skipped the Vegas sign photo op. ,,,,,,no review,,
Finally, the final destination and the end of the hop was the Chateau club located in the Paris hotel. This club was hopping and we partied for a couple  hours. ,,,,,,no review,,

We were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. ,,,,no review,,
I had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with unlimited meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). ,,no review,,
Going back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. ,,,no review,,
To end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.,,no review,,
Giving it two stars only because it was free dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!,1,V7tDW7E-VRyqPqbGdsuueA,,,,,no review,,

Decided to leave this place as our last meal in Vegas and I wouldn't want to have it any other way. Our server made our experience 10x times better. He was extremely attentive and friendly. He knew when to stop by and when not to. He knew what to recommend and to describe how everything was prepared. I will never forget asking him what the special of the night was and how well he described it that I had to ordered it. Beef Wellington. Unfortunately, they had run out of it. So he recommended I got the filet mignon, as this is what the restaurant is well known for. I do not regret listening to him. The steak was cooked perfectly. Medium never tasted so good. My brother had the filet mignon as well but his was with mashed potatoes and mine with fries. I ended up leaving him without mashed potatoes because they were too good for me not to eat them off his plate. They were creamy, fluffy and soft at the same time. ,,,,no review,,

But something spectacular happened to me that day. I didn't buy that chicken; I didn't even get to the grocery store. On my way there, I noticed the Butcher by Nature storefront, and I felt compelled to check it out and see what all this 'By Nature' business was all about.,,,,,no review,,
Butcher by Nature gives life to that lifeless chicken. Much like purchasing pedigree, the butcher and owner, Frank, knew all about my chicken and all the other chickens he was selling for that matter. He knew the farmers personally, and he knew that they were passionate about raising animals. He spoke proudly about the pesticide-free and natural-focused environment the farmers raised their livestock in. Clearly, this is a different kind of eating.,,no review,,
The shop is fairly small, but truly cozy, and the store is classic with more butchery area than retail shop. The retail area has shelves lined with locally-sourced dry products, like jams and honey, and fridges lined with locally-sourced meat products, like duck and eggs. Butcher by Nature also has a passionate, knowledgeable owner. Actually,forget that last bit; calling frank knowledgeable is an understatement. the art and science of butchery is seemingly ingrained in his bones. much like those chicken's proud lineage, Frank was raised to do butchery.,
Pesticide-free, hormone-void, locally-sourced meats, combined with an experienced owner and a pleasant store-front is what Butcher by Nature is all about. And of course, they're not limited to just chickens. They carry quite a large variety of meat including duck, venison, pork,and beef; all of it butchered and prepared in a bunch of different ways.,,
Fear not. Eating all this organic natural stuff isn't for just the rich. In fact, most of the products at Butcher by Nature are actually reasonably priced. In most cases, you can expect to pay just a few bucks more than you would at the neighbourhood grocery store. That, combined with the absolute passion surrounding what they carry makes it an easy choice for meat. Even if you're not in the area, Butcher by Nature is worth the trip.,,,no review,,
So, if you think that chickens, or most other animals for that matter, magically end up in refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of a grocery store, then you owe it to yourself to check out Butcher by Nature because when it comes to meat, it's all about where it comes from.,5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,

Upon tasting the first skewers that came out, my boyfriend commented on the temperature of the grill, that it wasn't hot enough. While I don't know much about grilling or temperatures, I trust his judgement in this area. As we received the rest of our skewers, each one had more char,and better flavor and texture.,,

My favourite dish was the Manchurian Mixed Fried Rice - it was just the right level of spice - it's definitely got some kick to it so if you aren't a big spicy food eater you might want to ask them to tone it down. Portion size was huge! We had enough for lunch and dinner the next day. ,,,,,,,no review,,
Underwhelming was the chicken pakoras - they were not that great compared to others we have had from at other Hakka places. They were also quite pricy for what you were getting.

Regarding the food - appetizers were just ok.

Our server had an attitude as if she didn't want to be there waiting on us. I had the Philly cheese steak & my mother had the American Burger. My sandwich had more onion and peppers then meat.

Finally as we were leaving, we were getting ready to pay and our server told the young boy to check us out, she told him to take off my moms food and he just gave us this look and rolled his eyes. We asked for military discount which was nice that they had since places never seem to do it anymore. I still don't understand how my philly steak & an ice tea came out to $22.

Place was clean, server prompt, nice. Salmon was dry, overcooked. Walnut and tempura shrimp were good but warm/cool, not hot. Liked the tofu and veggies. Fried prawns were tasty. Crab legs? Crab legs, nothing spectacular. The fried rice? Hardened, couldn't pay me to eat it. All the meat dishes,with the exception of almost well done prime rib (not happy that there was no one at the carving station to cut or anyone to call and ask) had an after taste of cough medicine - so did the tapioca, but cake was ok.,
Also almost got run over by the hostess while on my way to get food, she was rushing toward the empty side of the restaurant. My response? Smile, and an 'oh, sorry excuse me.' Hers a raised eyebrow that became a frown and a parting huff. Wanna pay over $20 for that plus tax and tip? Go for it lol, I'll pass.,1,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,no review,,

We started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti,but would be great as an entrée on its own.,,
The duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own.

Where the hell is the bacon?,,,,,,,no review,,
For a restaurant with pork-themed fare, there were disappointingly few dishes that contained bacon. Plenty of pâté, tenderloin and belly but no bacon. It just seemed weird.,,,,,no review,,
The cheese plate was very tasty and reasonably priced - $10 for three cheeses, toast points/crackers and small samples of red wine poached pears and roasted beets. The beets were the only thing out of place on the plate, and although this was the high point of the meal, it's hard to give Black Pig credit for something extremely difficult to screw up.,,,,no review,,
For the entree, I ordered the croque monsieur ($13) and my girlfriend ordered the pork tenderloin ($19). My sandwich arrived and was ENORMOUS.

3596,jGe5sKmpIStORtVbsd9yyQ,0,2014-07-28,4,6Dy8c5JTFt5AoQQSC_SR-Q,1,i am so disappointed with this hospital. this was the second time i came here, and each time was a HUGE disappointment. I am never returning. EVER. The vet's name is Melissa Schupp. ,
 First, I arrived around 2:35 on a Sunday afternoon. I called two hours ahead of time to schedule an appointment because I knew Sundays would be busy; this is because many other animal hospitals are not open on Sundays. My dog was suffering from unknown allergic reactions with skin rashes left and right. I had just adopted him, and his skin had recently become infected and rotten-smelling.,,,,,no review,,
 I called ahead of time, gave my details , a $77 quote and they reserved a room for me. When I arrived  the room was already reserved and I was led straight in. I initially thought I was going to have a great experience because of the quick room preparation but BOY was I wrong. When I was led into the room that was prepared, there was water all over the floor and the front desk lady hastily used paper towels to clean it up. I waited the standard 30 minutes in the smelly room until the nurse came into to check details, run temperature and give my dog a general physical. Then she left for AN HOUR. By this time it  was already 3:35, and my dog was whining from pain and discomfort in a closed off room. When the nurse returned and began to write down symptoms, my dog actually started peeing on floor. I didn't know what to do because I had no cleaning materials with me,so the nurse stepped into action and dropped a few paper towels on the ground. she didn't manage to soak up all the urine, so when she moved around, my dog was pushed into it and it ended all over my clothes when she asked for my to carry my dog onto the checkup table.
To make things worse, she left again for another hour, and checked in after the 40 minute mark to tell me the veterinarian would be with me after 1 minute. Ten more minutes passed and no one came. My dog was whimpering more and more at this point. Finally at 4:30, the vet comes in, smiling and kind, and asking me for doggie symptoms. I ask her about fleas, but I swear,this place was so profit driven that the vet did not even check my dog for fleas before giving me a prescription on my flea medication. the mere mention of i think my dog might have fleas but i don't know how to check for them initiated a conditioned response i'll prescribe flea medication without looking at the dog. i asked kindly to hint to her that my dog might not have fleas because the itchiness could be a symptom of allergies. she then shows me how to check for fleas, but doesn't find any as she shows me. She continued to write down a prescription for fleas on my bill without my knowing. Is this a professional business? How can they cheat people like this!,
As I continued to ask questions to make sure what my dog had, the nurse seemed to reply with more things to run up my medical bill. She gave my dog a unnecessary skin scrape for mites TWICE even though SHE SAID that it didn't seem like my dog had mites, she performed and charged me for the scrape all the same. Because I had never needed to have these operations performed, I did not know that it was an extra $30 to have skin scraped. She went to look at the scrapes under the microscope, and returned another hour later. By this time, it was 5:30 and my patience was running low. For three hours, I sat in a stuffy room,covered in urine and staring at my miserable dog scratching his skin to bloody scabby bits as the doctors and nurses neglected the both of us. honestly, I was so frustrated, I didn't even know what to do.  I had never experienced such a horrible medical visit. 
Around 5:35 when she returned, she apologized for being gone for an hour, and she said she had to look over a pet with a real emergency. I'm not here to disqualify her statement, because I understand that this is a real animal hospital and that other people may have pets who are dying. But I also understand that this is a FOR-PROFIT animal hospital, and if they don't even have enough vets to go around that I have to wait three hours for something that takes less than 50 minutes, I truly will never EVER recommend this place or ever set foot near this place again.,,no review,,
 After she came back, she confirmed my dog had no mites, and gave me a pet cone of shame that I had asked for earlier. She told me it was $15 cone, and gave me flea medication and antibiotics for the infection. She hardly looked at my pet. The only part of the visit that was clear to my mind was that she kept saying ow when my dog nibbled at her fingers.,,,,no review,,
I excitedly hurried out and paid my bill. EXCEPT IT WAS $207. I let the vet CUT MY DOG for $32, the flimsy cone was $30 in addition to the $29 un-needed flea meds. I cried.,,,,,,no review,,
I think my only mistake was coming to this hospital. Be wary of coming here as the more questions you ask to get a better idea of your dog's condition, the more services and products they try to shove down your throat to earn revenue.,10,0Q5EIFIxISWttluPPHh2ag,,,,no review,,
87,A2pHOVp0zh7grb1bbZxoBQ,0,2016-06-13,0,JvCsQXCkTkybpkJd8oSimw,4,love the house chicken and chicken fried rice. only ate here once a few years ago, they were super nice and food was yummy! ,
This is out take out spot though.  Dumplings are also good. Family fave is the chicken fried rice, mouth's watering just thinking about it. One serving is good for 3-4.,,,,,,no review,,

565,8Sx63K4KRZ0vGaUfZGqxZw,2,2016-01-14,1,lHPdv5p1y_fKAen2J_ijVg,1,-6 stars ...i have come here several times....,,
The staff is friendly. However, I feel they have not been properly trained in making the drinks they sell. ,,,,,,no review,,
The coffee beans are good quality however, sometimes the load is packed to tight and the espresso comes out with a burnt taste. Other times in a latte it is either too over heated or comes out like a cappuccino. ,,,,,,no review,,
In the simplest way put very inconsistent and not in anyway good. ,,,,,,,no review,,
Some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting (i.e. Small Almond croissant $4.20) ,,,,,,,no review,,
Today I ordered an Early Grey. The earl grey tea I had tasted moldy .... It also made me sick.... Which makes me question what type of hygiene they have there. ,,,,,,,no review,,
Will not be going back to this place ever .... They are a disgrace to cafes. ,,,,,,,no review,,
Tip* go to the Starbucks upstairs in the indigo or across the street... They are closer to what it should really taste like.... You will get the coffee, late, cappuccino or tea the way it should be done.,4,kBNFdviedCPFWyR-wVaAzw,,,no review,,
541,oqLPpDP4TIaHSRyxR4Rqdw,0,2007-10-02,0,wRooMtZCPaTnaPIoLa2TCg,4,one of my favorite places for breakfast in the area.  no frills, Mancini toast, reasonable prices (like $4 to $7 per person)
If you are really hungry, try the 3-egg scramble (3 scrambled eggs mixed with grilled onions, peppers, sliced italian sausage, and melted cheddar cheese) - with Mancini toast (and butter). If you finish all of it, you probably won't need to eat again until dinner.,,no review,,
The 2 & 3 egg combos are also good. Sandwiches for lunch are not bad, but breakfast is definitely a better call.,3,AlzerMK7z84E4KU6GjPzIQ,,,,no review,,
Everything else on the menu was enjoyable, with very good portion sizes - small enough that you have the opportunity to try multiple items. For example, the rolls come in 4's, so you can try more than one roll. Another plus was the dessert. They have black sesame ice cream, which I've never seen at AYCE sushi before, along with other jellos (black current and litchi), mango pudding and a chef's special. ,no review,,
While pricey, $24.99 on the weekends, I would say that its worth it.,0,hJulW1s6tOBr2NXD9nAoMQ,,,no review,,
While Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed diner feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many,and recommend some personal favourites.,,
Starting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.,no review,,
Bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.,,no review,,
If you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.,8,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,no review,,

I had given my husband some ideas of engagement ring designs I liked and after going to the traditional big box jewelry stores, a friend of ours recommended H&F.,,,,,,no review,,

Highly recommend the custard cakes they are the closest thing I have ever tried to the original Pastéis de Belém in Lisboa  ,,,,,,,no review,,
The rice flour cake is also really good and a good option for those whom do not like cake too sweet. ,,,,,,,no review,,
The bean cakes are great here too!  orange, almond, and a few others I have tried are all good. ,,,,,no review,,

3458,aLcFhMe6DDJ430zelCpd2A,0,2013-10-02,0,kwiEG_KCpDB6aK5fTSM7iw,2,we were expecting amazing thai food after all the reviews that we read and the fact that this place was voted one of the top 100 restaurants in toronto.,,
This was disappointing. ,,,,,,,no review,,
First off, it was really awkward sitting on the benches outside on the sidewalk, as people walked past us while to wait for our table. ,,,,,no review,,
Second, when we were seated, it was so loud. It felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. There was so much noise from people talking over each other and from the loud music. We were just happy that we didn't have to share a table with another couple. ,,,,,no review,,
Finally - Food was mediocre. I was extremely disappointed with the curry egg noodle dish. It was awkward to eat and I felt sick about half way through because the curry was too rich. On the flip side - I had a taste of my company's dish and it wasn't that great either - he had the beef stir fry dish with rice. The meat was nice and tender, but it wasn't flavourful. ,,,,,,no review,,
Wasn't worth the hype, unfortunately.,1,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ,,,,no review,,
